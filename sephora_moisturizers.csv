1. Domestically grown hemp from the cannabis sativa plant with less than 0.3% THC which is non-psychoactive. 
2. Full-spectrum CBD* or broad-spectrum CBD*. No CBD isolate*.
3. Triple-tested product for potency and contaminants* 
4. Publicly available Certificate of Analysis (COA) of the final formula from the manufacturer.
5. Compliant with Clean at Sephora standards.  
 
Fine print:
-Full-spectrum CBD: Contains CBD plus other compounds from the hemp plant. Less than 0.3% THC in the finished product which is non-psychoactive. These compounds are thought to work together to provide a synergistic effect. This may include terpenes, other cannabinoids (such as CBG, CBN, or CBC), flavonoids, and fatty acids. 
-Broad-spectrum CBD: Contains CBD plus other compounds from the hemp plant. THC is removed. These compounds are thought to work together to provide a synergistic effect. This may include terpenes, other cannabinoids (such as CBG, CBN, or CBC), flavonoids, and fatty acids. 
-CBD Isolate: A refined powder that has been stripped down to contain virtually pure CBD.  No other compounds of the hemp plant are included. 
-Testing: Every batch is tested three times. Testing is done on the raw hemp, the cannabinoid extract, and the final formula when manufactured. Testing confirms the product has no less CBD (in mg) than claimed on the label.
